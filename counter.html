<p>This is a <a
href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_include.html">server 
side include</a> "counter" function, built in to the Apache httpd
server.</p>

<hr>

<h2>How to set it up </h2>

<h3>First, turn your HTML document into a SHTML document. </h3>

<p>The first thing you have to do is adjust the filename
extension of your web page so that the server recognizes it as
containing server-side includes. Just change the extension to
.shtml. So, for instance, if your web page was named "<samp>index.html</samp>"
or "<samp>index.htm</samp>", your new web page should
be named "<samp>index.shtml</samp>". (Other valid
extensions for server-side include HTML documents on the Why? InterNetworking
web server are: "<samp>-s.html</samp>" and "<samp>-s.htm</samp>".)</p>

<h3>Next, create a file to hold the value of the counter. </h3>

<p>The first thing you have to do is create a file to hold the
value of the counter. This is an ASCII text file which contains
one line on which the the counter value is stored. This file must
always have the extension ".<samp>cnt</samp>". The file
can begin with any name, but we recommend that you use the same
base name as the .shtml file you intend to use it in. So, if your
web page was named, "<samp>index.shtml</samp>," then
name the counter file, "<samp>index.cnt</samp>". Put
this file on the server, with one line containing the number you
want the counter to start at.</p>

<p>When you put the counter file on the server, it must have
special "access permissions." It must be set read/write
by user, group, and other so that the HTTP server can read and
update it. You can use the chmod command to do this from your FTP
program or from the Unix shell prompt. </p>

<h3>Finally, add the counter to your SHTML document. </h3>

<p>Add the counter directive in your web page where you want the
counter to appear. This directive looks like a HTML comment. In
its simplest form, its "<samp>&lt;!--#counter
file="filename" --&gt;</samp>". Filename should be
the base name of the counter file, without the ".cnt"
extension. So, if your counter file is named
"counter.cnt", the counter directive you would use is
"<samp>&lt;!--#counter file="counter" --&gt;</samp>".
There you go, you now have a counter in your page. Bring up
Netscape and try it out!</p>

<h2>Advanced Options: </h2>

<p>You can do quite a bit more with the counter than just add one
to it for each hit. You can keep track of page hits silently,
adjust the appearance of the counter, and even do things like
rotating your home page through several backgrounds. Here is the
list of options you can give the counter directive:</p>

<p><font color="#804000"><samp>&lt;!--#counter
silent="no" width="0" nocommas="no"
min="0" max="2147000000"
rollover="no" increment="1"
ith="no" gfx="#" file="counter"
include="file%i.html" debug="" --&gt;</samp></font></p>

<p>Where: </p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>silent:</samp></font> Whether
        or not to show the value of the counter to the person
        accessing the page. <em>yes</em> - Don't show the counter
        to the page's accesser. <em>no</em> - Show the counter to
        the page's accesser (default). </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>width:</samp></font> The
        minimum width of the displayed counter (padded with 0's
        if necessary). </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>nocommas:</samp></font>
        Whether or not to insert commas into the number for
        readability. <em>yes</em> - Don't insert commas. <em>no</em>
        - insert commas (default). If width is not 0 then no
        commas are inserted regardless of the setting in
        nocommas. </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>max:</samp></font> The
        maximum number to count to. When the counter reaches this
        number, its behavior is controlled by rollover. By
        default the number is near two billion. </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>min:</samp></font> The
        minimum number to count down to. When the counter reaches
        this number, its behavior is controlled by rollover. By
        default the number is zero. </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>rollover:</samp></font> When
        you hit the maximum or minimum allowed number, what do
        you do? <em>yes</em> - Flip to the other endpoint. I.e.
        if at max, change to min. If at min, change to max. <em>no</em>
        - Stop counting. Do not add or subtract any further from
        the counter. </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>increment:</samp></font> The
        number to add to the counter. Default: 1. You may also
        use the keyword "random" which means that the
        next value of the counter should be a random number
        between min and max. </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>ith:</samp></font> Whether or
        not to append st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate to the end
        of the counter (i.e. 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>,
        4<sup>th</sup>, and so on.) <em>yes</em> - Add the
        extension. <em>no</em> - Don't add the extension
        (default).</li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>gfx:</samp></font> Use
        graphics (i.e. GIF files) to display the counter number
        instead of using a text counter. Put the html markup to
        include the graphics where "#" is the digit to
        replace. For example, if your counter were at 1,234 and
        you used the following line: &lt;!--#<samp>counter
        ith="yes" gfx="&lt;IMG
        SRC=\"gifs/#.gif\"&gt;"
        file="counter" --&gt;</samp> then it would be
        replaced by the html markup: &lt;IMG
        SRC="gifs/1.gif"&gt;&lt;IMG
        SRC="gifs/,.gif"&gt;&lt;IMG
        SRC="gifs/2.gif"&gt;&lt;IMG
        SRC="gifs/3.gif"&gt;&lt;IMG
        SRC="gifs/4.gif"&gt;</li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>file:</samp></font> The name
        of the file (minus the .<samp>cnt</samp> extension) to
        store the counter in. (For example, if your filename is
        "home.cnt" then you should use
        file="home".) <strong>Warning:</strong> the
        "file" directive must come <em>after</em>
        everything except include and debug.</li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>include:</samp></font> The
        "base" filename (where %i is the counter) of a
        file to include in to the document based on the value of
        the counter. (For example, if you want to include
        pageX.html where X is the value of the counter, use
        include="page%i.html".) </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000"><samp>debug</samp>,</font> if it
        exists, means print out the internal variables at the
        point in the command to assist in figuring out why the
        counter isn't working. This is provided for expert
        users... If you don't understand what its saying, don't
        use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh yeah. By the way, you are the <strong><!--#counter ith="" file="counter" --></strong> person to
read this page.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Suggested Uses:</h2>

<h3>Basic hit counter</h3>

<p><em>Add this to your web document:</em><br>
<samp>Welcome, you are the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;!--#counter
ith="yes" file="counter"

<p><em>And create the counter.cnt file. It looks like:</em><br>
